                <h2><em>What are your strengths?</em></h2>
                <p class="answer">My biggest strength is my ability to learn things quickly through completing a task or project. Another strength I have is to be able to adapt to any working environment and become an asset to my supervision. Being a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Air Force, I also have the ability to be a leader on a team.</p>
                <h2><em>What are your weaknesses?</em></h2>
                <p class="answer">My biggest weakness would have to be my pride. Sometimes my pride causes me to take on many task at once or stops me from asking for help with something. It is something I continue to work on by saying no more and asking for assistance when needed.</p>
                <h2><em>What was the most difficult thing about this portfolio?</em></h2>
                <p class="answer">The hardest part of this portfolio was finding images of myself to use for it. I don't take a lot of pictures. </p>
